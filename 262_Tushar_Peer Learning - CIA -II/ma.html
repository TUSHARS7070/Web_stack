              <p class="card-text">This is a really tough time for teens. I know what you’re thinking—the teen years
                have always been tough. But according to the U.S. Surgeon General in his advisory released in December,
                the pressure that teens are facing today is unprecedented. </p>

              <p class="card-text">BY JENNA WHITEHEAD | APRIL 18, 2022</p>
              <p class="card-text">he pandemic, climate crises, and global conflicts have left teachers with so much
                more to shoulder for their students—while they themselves try to cope with everything that is happening.
                Yet, while many teachers are barely able to stay afloat in these turbulent times, we often hear them
                lamenting that they feel like they are not doing enough for their students. But what do students really
                need? </p>

              <h5 class="card-title">How to Help Your Students Develop Positive Habits</h5>
              <p class="card-text">BY ARTHUR SCHWARTZ | AUGUST 16, 2022</p>
              <p class="card-text">Most students likely connect the term “habits” to their study habits. In fact, for
                many students the term “study habits” probably gives the notion of habits a negative vibe.
                But there is another type of habit that is important for the well-being and positive growth of students:
                habits that build their character strengths, such as patience, gratitude, and service to others. For
                example, the habit cue that helps students practice patience before spontaneously sending that angry
                tweet, or a daily habit of writing down what they are grateful for. I call these “positive habits.”</p>

              <p class="card-text">BY ERIN T. BARKER, ANDREA L. HOWARD | MAY 18, 2022</p>
              <p class="card-text">We are psychology researchers who study young people’s mental health during the
                transition to adulthood. In our research on university student stress and well-being, we’ve searched for
                patterns and predictors of distress to answer two related questions: When do students need help with
                academic demands? And which students need the most support?</p>
